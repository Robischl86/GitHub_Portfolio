# UWBCH2_Responsive_Website
This is the second homework assignment from the University of Washington's Coding Boot Camp.
I tried using various resources, including W3 and Bootstrap, to create a responsive website containing an About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. 
Unfortunately, I think that there were too many complicated elements that didn't mesh well together. 
For example, there is a gap that exposes the background pattern between my footer and my div. 
I will look into additional resources to see what I can improve.
